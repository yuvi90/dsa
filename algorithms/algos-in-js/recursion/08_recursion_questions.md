# Recursive questions for you to practice:

1. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
2. Implement a recursive function to find the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the digits of a positive integer.
4. Implement a recursive function to calculate the exponentiation of a base to a given power.
5. Create a recursive function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
6. Write a recursive function to reverse a string.
7. Implement a recursive function to generate all possible permutations of a given string.
8. Create a recursive function to determine if a given string is a palindrome.
9. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
10. Implement a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array.

These questions cover a range of difficulties and concepts, allowing you to practice recursion in various scenarios. Remember to follow the recursive problem-solving approach and consider the base case(s), recursive case, and how to combine the results of recursive calls to solve the problem.
