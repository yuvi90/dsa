# Linear Data Structure

Linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are arranged in a linear sequence, where each element is connected to its previous and next element. These structures allow for sequential access to the data, and the elements are usually stored contiguously in memory.

Here are some common examples of linear data structures:

1. Arrays: Arrays are a basic and widely used linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Elements in an array can be accessed using their indices.

2. Linked Lists: Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. They can be singly linked (pointing only to the next node) or doubly linked (pointing to both the next and previous nodes).

3. Stacks: Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. The last element added is the first one to be removed.

4. Queues: Queues are linear data structures that follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).

5. Strings: Strings can be considered as linear data structures, where characters are arranged in a sequence and can be accessed one by one.

6. Tuples: Tuples are ordered collections of elements, and they can be considered as linear data structures when the order of elements matters.

Linear data structures are commonly used in various algorithms and applications, and each type has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios. For example, arrays are efficient for random access but have fixed sizes, while linked lists are more flexible for dynamic sizing but may have higher overhead due to the need for node references. Stacks and queues are fundamental for managing function calls, memory allocation, task scheduling, and more.
